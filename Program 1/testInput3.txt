In the testInput3 file, you notice in the first few lines that the commands, symbols, and associated integer are on different lines. The program expects a response if the values are not given initially. From here, open creates a new scope, which performs a similar action as before, except with lookup. Green is therefore not found and will display it 'not found'. Now we insert green 1900 and leave the current scope. Based on the output, you notice that both lookup and global give you not found. Since the previous scope was neither in the top or global scope, it cannot be found. Finally, the program quits.
