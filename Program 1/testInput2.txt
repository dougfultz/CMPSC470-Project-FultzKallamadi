In the testInput2 file, we start of with opening the initial scope. From here, we placed values for yellow, red, and pink. We then performed a lookup on blue, where blue was not found. Next, we looked up red. Red was found within the same scope. To test scopes, we open a new scope and perform the lookup and global symbol for red. The results show that lookup does not find anything but global does.Next, we dump the values. We proceed to close the scope 3 times, even though there are only 2 in this case. When the third 'close' is entered, the system response with the SymbolTable as empty. Finally, the program quits.
